A Playstation Debugger 

In this repo you will find an .EXE file (Playstation executable) and ISO
that contains the Newroze Playstation Debugger. 
It is a debugger I have written that will enable you to launch and test Playstation code (ELF) via modern machines. 
To use this debugger you must have:

1. A Playstation with a cart (ActionReplay/Xplorer) to which you can directly upload the .EXE file. Or a modded Playstation on which you can run the burned ISO file.

2. A serial<->usb cable from the Playstation to your dev machine.

3. Mipsel-unknown-elf-gdb installed.

4. The Newroze GDB server: https://github.com/YusufCelik/newroze-psx-debugger

You can watch a demo of the debugger here:
